## How to Create an Issue

1. Go to the [Issues tab](../../issues) in the repository
2. Click the green **"New issue"** button
3. Choose the template that best matches your need
4. Fill out the form - all required fields are marked
5. Click **"Submit new issue"**
6. A Copilot coding agent can then be assigned to handle your request!

## What Makes a Good Issue?

Each template guides you through providing:

1. **Clear problem description** - What needs to be done and why
2. **Clear acceptance criteria** - What success looks like
3. **Enough context** - Examples, references, and related information
4. **Limitations and constraints** - Any special considerations

## Tips for Teachers

- **Be specific:** Instead of "fix the colors," say "change primary color to lime green (#32CD32)"
- **Include examples:** Reference existing features or other websites
- **Explain the why:** Help developers understand the context and importance
- **Attach screenshots:** A picture is worth a thousand words
- **Use the checkboxes:** The acceptance criteria help ensure nothing is missed

## Need Help?

If you're not sure which template to use or need assistance:
- Check the [documentation](../../docs/how-to-develop.md)
- Ask a colleague who has created issues before
- Create a basic issue describing what you need, and we can help refine it

Remember: These templates are designed to make your life easier! You don't need to be technical - just describe what you need in your own words, and the templates will ensure all necessary information is captured.
